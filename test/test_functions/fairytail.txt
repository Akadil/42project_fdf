Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there was a young man named Akadil who loved to solve problems. He used to ask his aunts and uncles to give him mathematical problems, so that he can spend his time solving them. 

One day, he was working on his fathers job and stumbled upon a very boring, long and repetitive task. It was a work that even a child can do, but still it was important and needed responsibility. So while doing the task, he noticed that each part of the task could be done by code, you just have to solve the problem of how to do it

He was thrilled. He had always wanted to solve the hardest problems ever existed. And now he knew what to do. Use the power of programming to solve the work process optimization problems and many more 

Very short ending haha, but the story was written in the very beginning stage, so I don't have full picture or clear understanding of what I am going to do. But I have direction and I am willing to work in any related directions

Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there was a young girl named Eliza who loved to create. She spent her days drawing and painting, weaving and sewing, and dreaming up new inventions. She was always tinkering with gadgets and gizmos, trying to make them better, faster, and stronger.

One day, while wandering through the woods, Eliza stumbled upon a magical tree. Its trunk was as wide as a castle wall, and its branches reached up to the clouds. The tree whispered to her in a soft, musical voice, "Dear Eliza, if you have a dream and work hard to achieve it, I will help you make it come true."

Eliza was thrilled. She had always dreamed of creating something big, something that would change the world. And now she knew just what to do. She raced back to her workshop and started sketching and designing, working day and night to bring her vision to life.

She tinkered and experimented, tried out different materials and shapes, and finally, after many long weeks, she had it: a giant robot, as tall as a mountain and as strong as a hundred horses. Its arms could lift entire houses, its legs could crush boulders, and its eyes glowed with a fierce intelligence.

Eliza climbed into the robot's cockpit and started it up. The ground shook as the giant metal giant came to life, and she felt its power coursing through her veins. She lifted her arms and shouted to the sky, "I have done it! I have created something very big!"

And the magical tree in the woods smiled, for it knew that Eliza's creation would bring joy and wonder to the world for generations to come.
